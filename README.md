# StreamingData

This project will demonstrate how Qlik Sense could work with Streaming Data. This Streaming application will always show up-to-date temperature and humidity sensor data from a REST API generating random data. This is done by using the partial reload functionality in Qlik Sense together with a NodeJs app using Qlik Enigma. The extension included in this project is used to suppress reload in progress errors and updated app error messages.

#### Be Aware

If you have multiple applications that you want to run simultaneously, be aware when you stop streaming in one application, it will stop streaming for all the applications.
